# v0.2.2 â€“ Add Decoding Logic + Translator Package

### Decode Feature

- Added `morseToChar` by reversing `charToMorse` map
- Implemented full `decode(morse: String)` method
- Extracted `decodeMorseWord()` helper for unit testing and clarity
- Connected decode to menu option [2] in Main loop

### Encode Refactor

- Extracted `encodeWord()` to mirror `decodeMorseWord`
- Renamed `splitWordsToList()` to `sentenceToWords()` for naming consistency

### Modular Design

- Introduced `translator` package to encapsulate:
    - `Translator.scala`
    - `MorseCode.scala`
    - `TranslatorTest.scala`
- Applied `private[translator]` visibility for internal helpers while keeping them testable

### Test Coverage

- Added unit tests for:
    - `encodeWord`
    - `decodeMorseWord`
    - Full encode/decode sentence round-trips
