# v0.2.0 – Add Interactive Menu (Encoding + Decode Stub)

## Interactive Flow

- Introduced user menu:
    - [1] Encode English → Morse
    - [2] Decode Morse → English *(placeholder)*
    - [0] Exit
- Loop continues until user chooses to exit
- Includes `askToContinue()` Y/N prompt after each action

### Control Loop

- Introduced `while` loop to keep the app interactive
- Users can perform multiple actions in a single session
- Main loop pattern:
  ```scala
  while (keepTranslating) {
    keepTranslating = handleMenuSelection() && askToContinue()
  }
