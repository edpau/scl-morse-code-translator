# v0.1.1 â€“ Refactor I/O and Improve Readability

##  Structural Changes

- Added `OutputHandler.scala` to manage all user-facing output
- Refactored `InputHandler.scala`:
    - Extracted prompt logic to `OutputHandler`
    - Now focused only on getting and sanitizing input: `getUserInput()`

##  Design Benefits

- Clear separation of input/output responsibilities
- Easier to maintain and test each module independently
